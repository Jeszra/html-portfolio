<h1>The Best Movies According to Me</h1>

<h2>My topp 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Spirit</h3>
<p>This is my favourit animation movie. 
I used to watch it all the time when I was a child.</p>

<h3>The Menu</h3>
<p>This movie is of the thriller genre. 
However it is rather intriguing than scary.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>To be honest I prefer the books over the movies, 
but I have to say that the director was able to capture
the magical world of Harry Potter quite well.</p>
